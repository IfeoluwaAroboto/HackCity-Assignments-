STEP ONE: Create a function with an initialized Variable in it's brakets.
         Use the split method to return a new array // let split = str.split()
STEP TWO: Use the reverse method to reverse the new created array. // let reverse = split.reverse()
STEP THREE: Use the join method to join all the elements together to a string. let join = reverse.join()
STEP FOUR: Return the third Variable. // return join.
